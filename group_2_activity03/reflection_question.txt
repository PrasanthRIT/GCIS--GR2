The choice of sorting algorithm influences search performance by enabling faster search methods like binary search, 
which works only on sorted data. Binary search, with O(logn) complexity, is far more efficient than linear searchâ€™s O(n) , 
particularly for large datasets. Efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort (both O(nlogn)) optimize the 
initial sorting time, making frequent searches afterward faster. Investing in a fast sorting method initially results in 
better overall performance, especially when many searches will follow.
Binary search is faster because it narrows down the search by cutting the data in half instead of checking it one by one. 
When the data is sorted first the binary search can find things in larger datasets much faster.
